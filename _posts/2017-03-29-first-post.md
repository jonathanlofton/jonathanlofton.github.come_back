So this is my first post, I think I'm going to dive into jekyll quite a lot in the upcoming days.

Let's try out some of the functionality, let's put a link right [here][here-gh].

And let's add a `code` snippet below...
{% highlight ruby %}
def who_is_the_man?(name)
  print "#{name} is the man!!!"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Alright, its official I'm going to use this first post as a cheat sheet for this blog.
