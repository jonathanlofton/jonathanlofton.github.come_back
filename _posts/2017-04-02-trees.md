Trees, Trees, Trees.

Binary Trees? Sorted Trees?..

What is a tree? and why have you heard of them?

<b>A Brief Overview of a Tree Data Structure:</b>

A tree is a data structure which is made of 'nodes'. The tree starts from a single node called the root
node, moving away from the root node you get into the branches which would be considered the
children of the root, and if you keep moving down (or up, depending on how the tree is depicted)
you will eventually reach the end, where there are no more children, these nodes are called the
leaf nodes. And to move through the tree so to speak is called traversing.

Ok so looking at this tree, how do I relate it to the things I have learned already? Like arrays, strings, etc...
Well, you can store the values in an array. And you could create the tree by building a class called tree,
with an initialized method

<b>Tree VS Binary Tree:</b>
  A Binary Tree Node will only split into <b>2</b> branches, whereas a Trees node can split
  into many branches.

<b>Binary Search Tree VS Binary Tree:</b>
  A Binary Tree will have children nodes of random value. In a Binary Search Tree going to the
  left child node will always go to a node that is equal or lower
  than the parent node, while going to the right will produce a higher node.

<b>Balanced Tree VS Unbalanced Tree:</b>
  Whether a tree is balanced or not means, do the number of nodes to the left of the root equal
  the amount of nodes to the right of the root. And even in a Balanced tree, it does not mean they are
  always literally equal, but it means that doing a sort will be more or less at O(log n) for insert and
  find.

<b>Complete Binary Trees</b>
A tree is considered complete if its filled in from left to right with no gaps inbetween, but the right
most could be missing and the tree would still be complete.

<b>Full Binary Tree</b>
Each parent has either zero or two children.

<b>Perfect Binary Tree</b>
is a tree that is both Full and Complete, meaning each parent has either zero or two children and
is filled in from left to right with no gaps. (2^k - 1 nodes where k is the number of levels.)


<b><u>Methods for Iterating through a Tree</u></b>

<b>In-Order Traversal</b>
Visits the left child, the root, then the right child.
{% highlight ruby %}
  def inOrderTraversal(TreeNode, node)
    if !node.nill?
      inOrderTraversal(node.left)
      visit(root)
      inOrderTraversal(node.right)
    end
  end
{% endhighlight %}

<b>Pre-Order Traversal</b>
Root, left child, right child.

<b>Post-Order Traversal</b>
left child, right child, root.


<b><u>Binary Heaps</u></b>
A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree.
