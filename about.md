Hello! My name is Jonathan Lofton, and this is my first website!

I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida where I studied chemistry. The semester before I graduated I was accepted into an internship program with the University of Washington, a few months after the internship I was hired on as a Research Assistant... meaning I would stay up in Washington for a while longer, sweet! About a year into my position as a research assistant I was introduced to computer programming... and it got me good!

Looking at my future I could either work as a lab technician for the rest of my life, or go to grad school, and more than likely become a consultant. I decided I didn't want to do that, and decided to go all in with programming. I will be attending App Academy for the May 2017 cohort and will hopefully be employed in San Francisco as a developer by the end of the year - that's the goal.

Wish me luck.
