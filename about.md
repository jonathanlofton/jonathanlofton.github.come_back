Hello! My name is Jonathan Lofton, and this is my first website!

I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida where I studied chemistry. The semester before I graduated I was accepted into an internship program with the University of Washington, a few months after the internship I was hired on as a Research Assistant... meaning I would stay up in Washington for a while longer, sweet! About a year into my position as a research assistant I was introduced to computer programming... and being able to create things again (I like to draw) and solve challenging problems that give you that sweet A-HA! moment got me hooked.

Looking at my current degree ( Chemistry ) I have a very good idea of what the future would hold for me in the work-force. I would become a lab technician, move up to an analyst position and then work for the city for the rest of my life doing the exact same EPA procedures. Or I could go to grad school ( for a masters ) and more then likely become a consultant. Both are nice, they would be stress free and comfortable, but I love the feeling I get from programming, solving new problems everyday, and I think its something I can excel at if I have the desire to do it after an eight hour day of work.

 So after about two or three months of studying after work and on the weekends, I decided I wanted to pursue programming more seriously and try and make it into a career. There were two options, either be self-taught with a vague direction of where to go, or go to a coding bootcamp ( I didn't see going back to school for computer science as an option, too long, too much money  ). I decided to go with a coding bootcamp because I believed it would be the fastest way from point-A to point-B, which is my goal. I settled on AppAcademy for the bootcamp I wanted to join, they have excellent placement, and a low acceptance rate, and their financial plan incentivizes them to prepare you the best they can for the workforce.

 So I was accepted into the AppAcademy program and will be moving to San Francisco for the May cohort, and I will be employed as a software developer by the end of 2017.

 I'm excited to start!
